### How to launch Badger Bytes for the first time

First, clone this repository ```git clone https://aidank1234/BadgerBytesClient.git```

Next, ```cd``` into the directory ```BadgerBytesClient``` wherever you cloned it

Once you do that, run ```npm install``` to install needed dependencies

Run ```npm start``` to start the application on port 3000

Go to ```http://localhost:3000/signupadmin``` to get to the first page of the application for admins

Go to ```http://localhost:3000/signupstaff``` to get to the first page of the application for staff

Since we don't want admins or staff making their own accounts, I have set up some users for us to use in the database:  return
  Admin:  return
    Username: admin  return
    Password: password  return
  Staff:  return
    Username: staff  return
    Password: password  return
